# QuickBuy
This project is based on the logic of a grab-and-go ordering system; 
much like how an inventory system works.
Users select their items and place an order, 
which they can then pay for and collect at a physical store.

## Local Setup
- Install Visual Studio 2022
- Download .NET Framework 4.7.2 (Source: [Here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework/net472))
